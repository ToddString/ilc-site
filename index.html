    <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 25px; text-align: left; line-height:1.6;">
        Our mission is to empower individuals affected by Spinal Cord Injuries by providing emotional support, education, advocacy,
        and a sense of community. We strive to improve quality of life, promote independence and foster a sense of hope, resilience, 
        and belonging.
      </p>  
    <h2>How We Help</h2>
      <p style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 25px; text-align: left; line-height:1.6;">
        Our peer‑led group gathers on the <strong>fourth Monday of every month</strong> to exchange lived‑experience insights,
        host guest therapists, and plan activities such as <strong>dining out at local restaurants, cheering on
        wheelchair‑basketball games and other adaptive sports, and joining local or state demonstrations in support of the
        Americans with Disabilities Act</strong>. <br> <br>
        We also curate a local resource list that covers rehabilitation services,
        transportation through the <strong>Wave Transit Mobility Assistance Program (MAP)</strong>, and grants for durable
        medical equipment across Mobile and the wider Gulf Coast. Whether you are newly injured or a seasoned survivor,
        <em>you'll discover practical help, genuine friendship, and a strong voice here.</em>

## Spinal Cord Injury Support in Mobile, Alabama – How We Help

Our peer‑led group gathers on the **fourth Monday of every month** to
exchange lived‑experience insights, host guest therapists, and plan
activities such as **dining out at local restaurants, cheering on
wheelchair‑basketball games and other adaptive sports, and joining local
or state demonstrations in support of the Americans with Disabilities
Act**. We also curate a local resource list that covers rehabilitation
services, transportation through the **Wave Transit Mobility Assistance
Program (MAP)**, and grants for durable medical equipment across Mobile
and the wider Gulf Coast. Whether you are newly injured or a seasoned
survivor, *you'll discover practical help, genuine friendship, and a
strong voice here.*

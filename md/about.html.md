## About Us

We are members of the Mobile, Alabama community who understand the daily
challenges of living with a spinal cord injury injuries. Our peer‑led
group supports SCI survivors and their caregivers through fellowship,
education, and advocacy.

Our mission is to create a welcoming environment where individuals can
share experiences, learn to cope strategies and find hope and strength
together. We recognize that people who haven't experienced a Spinal Cord
Injury can’t fully understand its impact—that’s why our lived experience
is so valuable.
